My battle in learning C


Yeah, here you can see all sort of crap that came along the way while I was trying to get the hang of C.
The most crappy programming language ever created, but the most used one. Nothing new on that point, since crap rules the world, after all. (Remember VHS being more used that BetaMax and VCC2000?)

Okay, bad jokes aside... It's just that C requires a lot of discipline and needs some "long ways" around to get things done, and I don't like that... :-/

Yeah, you can laugh if you want.....
Now you can see the "Unlicense" here... Well, please note that some files here could be either original or modified source codes from tutorial sites, which I used for experimentation.... It can therefore be advisable to ask me first if it's okay to use these, if you really see something useful. If you wanna experiment with them yourself... Go ahead....
